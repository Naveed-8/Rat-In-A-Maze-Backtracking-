# Rat-In-A-Maze-Backtracking-
PROBLEM DEFINITION: 
Maze game is a well-known problem, where we are given a grid of 0’s and 1’s, 0’s corresponds to a place that can be traversed, and 1 corresponds to a place that cannot be traversed (i.e. a wall or barrier); the problem is to find a path from bottom left corner of grid to top right corner; immediate right, immediate left, immediate up and immediate down only are possible (no diagonal moves). We consider a variant of the maze problem where a cost (positive value) or profit (negative value) is attached to visiting each location in the maze, and the problem is to find a path of least cost through the maze.
